# Website Portfolio

## Introduction

This is my website portfolio for my own personal projects to show to future employers or internships. Obviously any code from a project can simply be saved and seen over github, but the portfolio can serve as an additional piece to view some of the projects visually without having to run it with an IDE. The portfolio is only composed of two webpages. One is to display general information about myself and the other for displaying projects. The project page will be showing graphic designs, websites, and school projects. Although, I will keep updating the portfolio as I go while I am still a student. Any new update will be shown below under the **Updates** section without having to look into the commits here on github within this project. Regardless, the source code will still be uploaded to github for any new projects I add towards this portfolio.

## Updates 

* This website portfolio was done back in 2017. Although, I updated my old portfolio to React in order to stay up to date with current web development practices. To take a look at my old portfolio, you can visit the source code *here*. You will notice that the react version looks much cleaner compared to the older version.

* The projects page was also updated by creating my own modal instead. Back when I didn't know much about JavaScript, I downloaded a website modal source code and added it to my portfolio instead. Now that I understand Javascript, I managed to create my own that works along with React.

* While the portoflio can be considered a website itself, I will be adding seperate future websites under the projects website tab instead. In the meantime, the tab will show a message displaying *Currently under construction!*. 

## Watch Content 

* The way the states where coded under the .jsx files need to be on the look out.

* Added a server.js file to work along with Heroku deployment. If you ever use another platform to deploy (i.e. github), you might need to make some adjustments under this file and webpack.config.js.

* CSS selectors to stay on the lookout as you update the portfolio: 

## To-do & Fixes 

* Media queries need to still be added for portrait mode. Some devices work fine but other media queries need to be added.

* Apply redux in order to better control the states within react files.

* Add a programs tab to projects.html to display school programs that you think could be relevant to show.

* Organize your folders and files more neatly within your project. Instead of having everything mostly on 

* Upload the old web portfolio to github to show the improvements between the old and the new one. Include a link at the top under updates within the first bullet where it says 'here'.
