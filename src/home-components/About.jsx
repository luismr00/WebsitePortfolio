        <p>Hi, my name is Luis Rangel, and I am a Computer Science student from California State University Northridge aiming to specialize in Graphic Design and Full-Stack Development. The current skills that I am familiar with at the moment are C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, React.js, Express.js, and MySQL. I also have skills in both Photoshop and Illustrator where I work with graphic design projects from time to time. While most of my strengths lie currently in front-end, I still aim to learn more about back-end in the near future.</p>
