        <p>Hi, my name is Luis Rangel, and I am a Computer Science student with a specialization in Graphic and Web Design. My current programming skills at the moment are C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Express.js. I also have skills in both Photoshop and Illustrator where I work with graphic design projects from time to time. There is still a lot to learn but I do make sure to keep learning new things aside from school projects in order to increase my proficiency as a developer. </p>
